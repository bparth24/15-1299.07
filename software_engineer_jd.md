### üîç **Minor Gaps or Differences**

| **Aspect**                                                                                                                                      | **Comment**                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The job description focuses on **decentralized identity (DID/VC)** and not necessarily **financial blockchain systems (e.g., cryptocurrency)**. | Still very much in scope for a Blockchain Engineer, especially one focused on identity and trust frameworks. |
| It does not mention **smart contracts** or **blockchain node management** explicitly.                                                           | But that‚Äôs not required in all Blockchain Engineer roles‚Äîespecially identity-focused ones.                   |

### üü¢ **Verdict: Strong Alignment**

* This job is **absolutely within the scope of a Blockchain Engineer** as defined by O\*NET, especially one focused on **decentralized identity (DIDs, VCs), W3C standards, and trust frameworks** rather than financial crypto.
